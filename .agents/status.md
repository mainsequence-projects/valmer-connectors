## Runtime and Schema

- Local runtime: CPython `3.13.11`, Main Sequence `6.0.27`, ms-markets
  `0.0.104`.
- Main Sequence and the copied managed skills pin are aligned.
- MetaTable data source: `3bde59a2-af55-439f-9584-a954b165324c`.
- ms-markets migration provider is current at revision `0015`, with 55 active
  application tables and no failed definitions.
- The Valmer migration provider is current at clean baseline revision `0001`.
  It owns exactly:
  - `valmer_connectors__valmerassetdetails`;
  - `valmer_connectors__vector_de_precios_valmer`;
  - `ms_markets__index_values__t_1d`.
- No project-specific reference-rate storage, runtime compatibility decoder,
  translator, or migration export utility exists.
- `valmer-connectors runtime validate` resolves the four current curve
  definitions and eight current Index/convention definitions.

## Completed Updates

All current producers and curves were executed after schema recreation:

- FRED reference rates: 6,814 rows;
- Banxico policy target: 1,819 rows;
- Banxico supported fixings: 26,430 rows;
- Valmer MXN quote snapshot: 34 Index observations;
- Valmer USD quote snapshot: 47 Index observations;
- dependency-backed TIIE curve: one row;
- dependency-backed SOFR curve: one row;
- dependency-backed USD/MXN XCCY curve: one row;
- vector history: 248 source dates from 2024-08-30 through 2025-08-27;
- government curve: 248 rows rebuilt from persisted vector observations.

The government source loader now permits the required governed-query volume,
uses SDK pagination, and rejects truncated results. This fixed the earlier
1,000-row read ceiling before the final government rebuild.

## Persisted-Data Audit

`scripts/verify_current_pipeline.py` passed against the local platform data:

- `IndexValuesTS.1d`: 8,633 reference-rate observations and 81 Valmer quote
  observations across 81 quote identities;
- `IndexFixingsStorage`: 26,430 observations across seven indices;
- government vector: 13,083 rows across 248 dates, including 9,029 CETES rows
  across 87 identities and 4,054 M Bonos rows;
- curve storage: 248 government rows plus one TIIE, one SOFR, and one XCCY row;
- key nodes: 15 TIIE, 23 SOFR, 17 XCCY, and 12,761 government;
- all 55 quote-backed source references are typed `index` and resolve to the
  exact-date persisted Index value;
- all 12,761 government source references are typed `asset` and resolve to the
  exact-date persisted vector observation.

## Strict Failure Behavior

Vector registration no longer silently omits a pricing target when its current
instrument cannot be built. Missing instrument payloads are included in the
fatal refresh set and the exception reports the source schedule context.

The vendor row `F_BINVEX_24484` contains a schedule that the current pricing
adapter cannot reconcile (76 remaining 28-day coupons with a 2024-11-28
maturity). It is not part of the CETES/M Bonos government curve universe. A
strict broad vector replay now stops on this row until its source schedule is
corrected; no identifier-specific bypass was added.

## Repository Validation

- Focused strict-pricing and government-query tests pass.
- The repeatable persisted-data verification passes.
- Full suite: 246 tests and 39 subtests pass.
- Ruff, `uv lock --check`, and `git diff --check` pass.
- MkDocs is not installed in the project environment, so no documentation-build
  success is claimed.
