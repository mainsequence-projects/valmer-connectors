description: Use this skill when extending or reviewing the ms-markets Asset model, including AssetType registration and one-to-one asset property/detail tables. This skill owns the rule that AssetTable stays small and extension data belongs in relational detail tables keyed by AssetTable.uid.

# Main Sequence Markets Asset Model Extension

Use this skill when an agent needs to add, review, or document asset identity
extensions in `ms-markets`.

## Core Rule

`AssetTable` is the canonical asset registry. Keep it small.

Do not add instrument, venue, provider, or lifecycle columns to `AssetTable`.
Examples of fields that do not belong there: maturity, expiry, strike, issuer,
exchange metadata, FIGI payloads, pricing terms, provider tickers, or raw
provider responses.

Extend the asset model with relational composition:

```text
AssetTable.uid 1 ---- 1 ExtensionDetailsTable.asset_uid
```

## AssetType

Use `AssetType` to register what an `Asset.asset_type` string means.

Current contract:

- `AssetTypeTable.asset_type` is unique.
- `AssetTypeTable` may also store `display_name`, `description`, and
  `metadata_json`.
- `Asset.asset_type` should match a registered `AssetType.asset_type`.
- In this release, `Asset.asset_type` is a logical classification string, not a
  database foreign key.
- Typed `msm.api.assets` payloads normalize asset type keys by stripping
  whitespace, lowercasing, and replacing whitespace runs with `_`.

Agent workflow:

1. Register or upsert the needed `AssetType` before creating assets of that
   type.
2. Use short, stable type keys such as `equity`, `crypto`, or `future`.
3. Put explanatory text in `display_name` and `description`, not in the key.

```python
from msm.api.assets import Asset, AssetType

AssetType.upsert(
    asset_type="future",
    display_name="Future",
    description="Futures contracts represented as market assets.",
)

asset = Asset.upsert(
    unique_identifier="future-example",
    asset_type="future",
)
```

## One-To-One Asset Detail Tables

For one-to-one asset properties, use `asset_uid` as both:

- the primary key of the detail table
- the foreign key to `AssetTable.uid`

Do not add a separate `uid` column to one-to-one detail tables.

Recommended SQLAlchemy shape:

```python
class FutureAssetDetailsTable(MarketsMetaTableMixin, MarketsBase):
    __metatable_identifier__ = "FutureAssetDetails"

    asset_uid: Mapped[uuid.UUID] = mapped_column(
        Uuid(as_uuid=True),
        ForeignKey(f"{AssetTable.__table__.fullname}.uid", ondelete="CASCADE"),
        primary_key=True,
        nullable=False,
        info={"description": "Canonical AssetTable uid for this detail row."},
    )
```

Add only fields that belong to that specific extension. Use indexed columns for
lookup keys and JSON/text columns for provider payloads when the payload is not
part of the canonical asset identity.

For project-local extension tables, define an abstract project-local mixin with
the project's default `__metatable_namespace__` and, when needed,
`__markets_storage_app__`. Concrete extension tables should declare
`__markets_base_identifier__` as the bare table concept. ms-markets combines the
mixin namespace and base identifier into the globally unique MetaTable identity
used by runtime attachment.

`MSM_AUTO_REGISTER_NAMESPACE` still overrides the mixin namespace when it is set
before model import. Use that for isolated tests and examples.

Changing `__metatable_namespace__` or `__markets_storage_app__` after the table
has been migrated and registered is a logical or physical table rotation and
must go through the SDK migration and registration path.

```python
class MyProjectMarketsMetaTableMixin(MarketsMetaTableMixin):
    __abstract__ = True
    __metatable_namespace__ = "com.my_project"
    __markets_storage_app__ = "my_project_markets"


class MyAssetDetailsTable(MyProjectMarketsMetaTableMixin, MarketsBase):
    __markets_base_identifier__ = "MyAssetDetails"
```

## Public API Pattern

After the SDK migration provider has migrated and registered the SQLAlchemy
detail model, application code should attach it through `msm.start_engine(...)`
and then work through the Pydantic row API:

1. Upsert the `AssetType`.
2. Upsert the canonical `Asset`.
3. Upsert the detail row with `asset_uid=asset.uid`.

```python
import uuid

import msm
from pydantic import AliasChoices, Field

from msm.api.base import MarketsMetaTableRow


class FutureDetails(MarketsMetaTableRow):
    __table__ = FutureAssetDetailsTable
    __required_tables__ = [FutureAssetDetailsTable]
    __upsert_keys__ = ("asset_uid",)

    uid: uuid.UUID = Field(validation_alias=AliasChoices("uid", "asset_uid"))
    asset_uid: uuid.UUID

msm.start_engine(models=[FutureAssetDetailsTable])
```

`MarketsMetaTableRow` is the Pydantic row-operation wrapper. It is not
registered as a backend MetaTable. The SQLAlchemy detail model class is the
registered backend artifact. If generic row helpers expect `uid`, expose `uid`
as an alias of `asset_uid` in the Pydantic row model. Do not change the SQL table
shape just to satisfy generic helpers.

## Currency Spot Reference Pattern

`CurrencySpotAssetDetailsTable` is the built-in currency spot extension
pattern. Single currencies such as `USD` and `EUR` are normal `Asset` rows with
`asset_type="currency"`. The spot pair is a normal `Asset` with
`asset_type="currency_spot"`; the detail table stores `asset_uid`,
`base_currency_uid`, and `quote_currency_uid` as references to `AssetTable.uid`.

Use the class-owned API workflow instead of requiring callers to pass table
handles:

```python
from msm.api.assets import Asset, CurrencySpot

EUR = {"code": "EUR", "currency_name": "Euro"}
USD = {"code": "USD", "currency_name": "US Dollar"}

eur = Asset.upsert(unique_identifier=EUR["code"], asset_type="currency")
usd = Asset.upsert(unique_identifier=USD["code"], asset_type="currency")

pair = CurrencySpot.upsert(
    unique_identifier="BBG0013HGRV5",
    base_currency_uid=eur.uid,
    quote_currency_uid=usd.uid,
)
```

Do not widen `AssetTable` with `base_currency_uid` or `quote_currency_uid`;
those are extension detail fields.

## Bond Reference Pattern

`BondAssetDetailsTable` is the built-in bond extension pattern. A bond is a
normal `Asset` row with `asset_type="bond"`. The detail table stores `asset_uid`,
`issuer_uid`, `currency_asset_uid`, `issue_date`, `maturity_date`, and
`status`.

Issuers are reference rows in `IssuerTable`, not assets and not loose strings.
Use `Issuer` for issuer reference data, then link bonds through `issuer_uid`.

Use the class-owned API workflow:

```python
import datetime as dt

from msm.api.assets import Asset, Bond
from msm.api.issuers import Issuer

issuer = Issuer.upsert(
    unique_identifier="example-issuer",
    display_name="Example Issuer",
)
usd = Asset.upsert(unique_identifier="USD", asset_type="currency")

bond = Bond.upsert(
    unique_identifier="example-usd-bond-2031",
    issuer_uid=issuer.uid,
    currency_asset_uid=usd.uid,
    issue_date=dt.date(2026, 5, 27),
    maturity_date=dt.date(2031, 5, 27),
    status="ACTIVE",
)
```

Do not widen `AssetTable` with issuer, currency, issue date, maturity date, or
status fields. Those belong to `BondAssetDetailsTable`. Pricing terms, coupons,
schedules, and instrument dumps belong to pricing/instrument contracts, not the
minimal bond asset extension.

## OpenFIGI Reference Pattern

`OpenFigiAssetDetailsTable` is the built-in example of this extension pattern.

Required architecture:

```text
+-----------------------------+        one-to-one provider      +-----------------------------+
| AssetTable                  |-------------------------------->| OpenFigiAssetDetailsTable   |
| uid                  PK     |        asset_uid PK/FK          | asset_uid            PK/FK  |
| unique_identifier    unique |                                 | figi                        |
| asset_type                 |                                 | isin / ticker / metadata    |
+-----------------------------+                                 +-----------------------------+
```

For OpenFIGI and similar providers:

- keep canonical identity in `Asset`
- keep provider-specific facts in the provider detail table
- do not register assets with raw ticker symbols as `Asset.unique_identifier`;
  tickers can collide, change, and require exchange/security context
- when only a ticker is available for a listed provider-backed asset, resolve it
  through OpenFIGI with the required market/exchange/security context and use
  the resolved FIGI as the stable `Asset.unique_identifier`
- store raw provider response separately from normalized lookup columns
- preserve existing column mappings such as `metadata_text =
  mapped_column("metadata", Text, nullable=True)`

## Boundaries

- For timestamped or panel data keyed by assets, use the
  `AssetIndexedDataNode` skill and docs instead.
- For price histories, do not add price columns to asset or detail tables.
- For portfolio or holding semantics, use portfolio-specific models.
- For provider lookup services, keep API-key and normalization logic in
  services, then persist only normalized asset/detail rows.

## Validation Checklist

When changing asset extension code, verify:

- `AssetTable` did not gain extension columns.
- new asset type strings are represented by `AssetType`.
- one-to-one detail tables use `asset_uid` as the only primary key.
- detail table foreign keys point to `AssetTable.uid` and use cascade delete when
  the detail row should not outlive the asset.
- Pydantic row models, repository helpers, tests, docs, and examples match the
  table identity shape.
- startup examples call `msm.start_engine(models=[DetailTable])` after SDK
  migrations, not direct registration or row-level schema helpers.
